        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This butcher or hanger steak recipe is great pan-cooked, broiled, or grilled. It takes to marinade wonderfully and really can be substituted for any cut of steak.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) butcher's steak (hanger steak)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>â…” cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove all silver skin and extra fat from steak.</li>
            <li>Carefully cut out the connective tissue that connects the 2 halves of the steak, separating the whole into 2 long pieces.</li>
            <li>Cut lobe of meat from one half (it's a piece that is slightly separated from the larger half).</li>
            <li>Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Heat skillet over high heat. Add clarified butter when pan is hot, then place the steaks in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. </li>
            <li>Cook until browned on all sides, firm, and reddish-pink on the inside. </li>
            <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), a total of about 12 minutes. (This cut of meat has a sort of triangular shape, so about 4 minutes per side.) </li>
            <li>Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let steaks rest and allow temperature to rise to 130 degrees F. </li>
            <li>Pour broth into skillet set over medium heat. Stir with a wooden spoon scraping up the browned bits from the bottom.</li>
            <li>When brownings dissolve and liquid begins to reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce heat to low. </li>
            <li>Add accumulated juices from the meat, balsamic vinegar, and butter chunks. Cook and stir until butter melts. </li>
            <li>If liquid has reduced too much, add a splash of broth. Taste to check if sauce needs a bit of salt. </li>
            <li>To serve, slice steaks and spoon pan sauce over them. </li>
        </ol>
